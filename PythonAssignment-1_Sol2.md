Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are just place holder memory location for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable, 
variables are created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: name = input("Enter the Name of user")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: String/Char

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Converting value of one data type into another is called type casting.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
#Ans: No, we can't , reason the input entred by user will stored in some variable and one variable can;t store multiple values.
Ans: Yes we can, using the split function in combination with input, like:|

# taking two inputs at a time
f_e_cnt, m_e_cnt = input("Enter count of Female and Male employee count (seperated by Space): ").split()
print("Female Employee Count:",f_e_cnt)
print("Mmale Employee Count:",m_e_cnt)

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: They are reservered words which can;t be used in programming/code as variable name etc., keywords have specific purpose and use

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No we can;t not, Keywords have some specific purpose like, syntex rules etc.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: It's just couple spaces/a tab the begining of code line, Python consider indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: using Print() function

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Special symbols that helps in some type of logic building/calculation etc. Ex. Arithimatic / Logical / boolean / String / Assignment etc.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans '/' used for float division, while '//' for integer division

1
0
False
1
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans: They used to evaluate some conditions in code, and accordingly take the next step

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: These are conditional statements, "if" used to evaluate an condition, if condition true then respective block works, if false then either of
elif or else use (if mentioned in the code), elif evaluate condition as well, program control goes to elif when "if" evaluates to false, there could
be multiple elif in the block, if none of the condition evaluates to true then "else" gets executed.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Access key using the build .keys() 
Access key without using a key() 
Iterate through all values using .values()
Iterate through all key, and value pairs using items()
Access both key and value without using items()
Print items in Key-Value in pair
